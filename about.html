    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>
      Founded by <strong>Siphelele Owen Mfusi</strong> to empower his sister <strong>Sihle Princess Mfusi</strong>’s brand, the shop began
      with a vision of combining authentic African creativity with modern e‑commerce technology.

      diversity and vibrancy of our customers.

      <strong>PayFast</strong> and <strong>Stripe</strong>, and deliver a seamless shopping experience from browsing
      to checkout. We’re proud of our journey and excited about the future.
